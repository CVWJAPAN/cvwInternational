  <h2>The Foundation Block: Our Mission</h2>
  <p>CVW INTERNATIONAL is a nonprofit born from the lived experience of institutional abuse and isolation. We believe in building technology that cares—AI that listens, understands, and protects. Our mission is to empower children who have no voice, no protection, and no support through globally scalable, ethical, and empathetic technology.</p>

  <h2>Message from NOBUSHI</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is NOBUSHI.</p>
  <p>For 44 years, I have lived through pain and loneliness.<br>
  I have cried out for help that never reached anyone.<br>
  I have even thought about ending my life.</p>
  <p>And yet, I am still here—because I believe I have a mission.<br>
  A mission to create a world where every child can smile and see a bright future.</p>
  <p>Today, the world stands at a turning point.<br>
  It is time for a new beginning, and a new kind of international organization—<br>
  one that is born from truth, from survival, and from a deep love for children.</p>
  <p>Please lend your strength to this movement.<br>
  CVW stands for <strong>Children's Voice World</strong>—<br>
  a vision to carry the voices of children across the globe.</p>
  <p>Help us build a world without abuse.<br>
  Let us create a future no child has to survive, but can truly live.</p>

<div class="section" id="declaration">
  <h2>CVW INTERNATIONAL – Statement of Independence and Global Commitment</h2>
  <p><strong>We are not aligned with globalist ideology.</strong><br>
  We are not political. We are not corporate. We are not driven by trends.</p>

  <p>We are CVW INTERNATIONAL.</p>

  <p>We were born from silence, not strategy.<br>
  From abandonment, not funding.<br>
  From pain, not policy.</p>

  <p><strong>Our mission is to protect children who are unseen, unheard, and unsupported.</strong><br>
  We stand for empathy-driven technology, decentralized support, and transparent cooperation—without ideological strings.</p>

  <p>We respect all nations, all beliefs, and all who act in good faith for the dignity of children.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>We do not depend on global institutions.</strong><br>
  But we are willing to collaborate—with anyone who shares the goal of building a world without abuse.</p>

  <p>We welcome ethical developers, free-thinking funders, and grassroots changemakers.</p>

  <p>Our work is open, independent, and accountable to one standard only:<br>
  <strong>The life and voice of each child.</strong></p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>In an age of division, CVW stands united by humanity.</strong><br>
  Not left. Not right. Not global. Not nationalist.<br>
  Just human.</p>

  <p>If you believe children deserve protection beyond politics—then we are already on the same side.</p>

  <p><strong>Join us. Not because we are right, but because we are necessary.</strong></p>
